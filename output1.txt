“But we are taking this step out of an abundance or precaution and prudence.” Murphy said the emergency declaration “responsibly removes bureaucratic barriers to make sure we have the resources and supplies our front line public health and safety professionals need to do their jobs.” “The fact that we are continuing to see additional cases is concerning but it is not unexpected.
James Cai, a 32-year-old physician’s assistant, was the first patient who tested positive for the coronavirus in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
It’s very serious,” said James Cai, New Jersey’s first coronavirus case.
Cai works and lives in both Manhattan and Fort Lee. He went to an urgent care clinic and then the emergency room at Hackensack University Medical Center, where he’s been hospitalized since Tuesday.
The 32-year-old physician’s assistant, a non-smoker with no underlying health conditions, believes he contracted it while attending a medical conference in Times Square last weekend, saying the coronavirus spread quickly to both his lungs.
This spreads like the flu, but most people who have it will get on with their lives,” Cuomo said.
Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday.
In New York City, where more than a dozen cases have been confirmed, school trips abroad and non-essential international travel for city workers have been canceled.
Do you think I would allow a young child to use this STUFF, look what happened a few years ago with hand cleaner that contained alcohol they were getting drunk and sick using it in school .
Not for nothing, this guy was a PA, he thought he had this virus and went to an Urgent Care clinic and an ER.
This virus is likewise killing and making a large number of the older population very sick.
If we want to have these beloved family members around then the younger population needs to try to stop the spread of this virus.
As we saw last week in Kirkland, WA, once the virus gets inside a senior facility, disaster is imminent.
While senior facilities (assisted living, nursing homes.
Further, many elder facilities allow residents to live with their pets and we now know that canines can catch coronavirus thus potentially be carriers too.
Senior facilities have the potential to be death camps due to their elderly populations, along with protocols not known to be adequate and still many unknowns about the virus.
“once the virus gets inside a senior care facility, disaster is imminent”  I’m sorry but no matter the cause of death in a senior living facility can hardly be described as  a “disaster!” so dramatic.
Well, we know you  have no family members in a senior care facility.
